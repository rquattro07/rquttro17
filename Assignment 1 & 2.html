 <p>The article by Kate Wagner begins with her recalling the first time she logged onto the internet in 1998 with her father to see what questions the web could answer. At the young age of five years old, this was Kate's first encounter with the web, but definitely not the last. Kate's father worked for the government, so her family adapted to the internet early on. In the article, Kate says, "As she grew up, so did it." Kate then goes on to discuss how rapidly the internet took over the world of schooling, replacing library searches with Google searches. New web pages were created over the years, becoming popular and heavily used, each creating its own culture and way of life. The article references media scholar Geert Lovink for sorting internet culture into three time periods, breaking down the progression of its usage. As stated by Geert Lovink, "First, the scientific, pre-commercial, text-only period before the World Wide Web. Second, the euphoric, speculative period in which the Internet opened up for the general audience, culminating in the late 1990s dot-com mania. Third, the post-dot-com crash/post-9/11 period, which is now coming to a close with the Web 2.0 mini-bubble."" The author notes that she and her generation grew up in the second period, which she does not speak highly of. Kate describes this time as when social media began to take over, and it did so quickly. She reminisces about the internet days before social media and wishes she could go back. Kate even goes so far as to say, "The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism."</p>

<p>Although I did not grow up in the same time period as the author, at this point in the article, I began to relate to her feelings about the growth of the internet and, more specifically, the integration of social media. I agree that social media has quickly taken over the internet, but not always in the best ways. Social media, as a concept, had so much promise and potential, but I feel it has failed to deliver on that promise. While social media facilitates easier communication, opportunities to connect with more people, and access to different parts of the world, it also comes with significant downsides. It is a major factor in bullying, harassment, and stalking. Cyberbullying is a serious threat, and the ability to remain annonymus on social media means there is often no accountability or way to trace perpetrators. Because of this risk-free environment, bullying and harassment on the internet became an epidemic shortly after the rise of social media. Kids all over the world experienced cyberbullying and felt powerless to stop it or identify the culprits. Another issue with social media is the easy access to personal information that people display. Many individuals share details like their location, full name, family members, friends, and loved ones. While there are measures to protect this information, it is still misused in harmful ways. Social media had immense potential, but it has quickly become a platform for negative possibilities.</p>

<p>Although Kate makes many good points and expresses relatable feelings, I don't agree with everything she says in the article. She compares Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, a difference she has a lot to say about. Kate expresses, "Web 1.0 required users to manually code, design, and manage their own spaces on the net." She then contrasts this with Web 2.0, which she finds effective but dislikes for being too clean-cut and perfect. The author feels that because well-designed, clean-cut pages have taken over the internet, it’s no longer possible to have "ugly" personal web pages created by small creators. She argues that "although Web 2.0 encourages a broader, ever more interconnected amateur web population to upload, share, record, and participate at increasing rates, it does so by erasing the personalized, Geocities-style “Welcome to my Home Page” aesthetic long disliked by web designers and other professionals. Users, in other words, must now operate within the constraints of polished interfaces designed by experts." While I agree that Web 1.0 was interesting and allowed for creative personalization, I believe improvement is necessary. As Kate herself notes, Web 2.0 "encourages the broader, ever more interconnected amateur web population to upload, share, record, and participate at increasing rates."" Web 2.0 is far more effective than Web 1.0. Though it may lack the ability to express creativity in the same way, there are still well-crafted, interesting, and interactive personalized websites out there, even if they are less common. Nostalgia is valuable, but progress is also important.</p>

<p>This article is very well written and makes many good points. I’m sure many people from the early web era reminisce while reading it. Even as someone who did not experience that time period, I learned a lot about the history of the web and its evolution. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the opinions and views of someone who experienced a different phase of this crucial technological development. Of course, I did not agree with all of Kate’s opinions, but I found her perspectives both informative and engaging.</p>
