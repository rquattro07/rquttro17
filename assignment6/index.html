			<p> "American capitalism, Fat and Mean, economist David Gordon emphasized income adequacy. The “vast majority of US households,” he argues, “can barely make ends meet.... Meager livelihoods are a typical condition, an av- erage circumstance.” Meanwhile, the Eco- nomic Policy Institute focuses on the distribution of income and wealth, argu- ing that the gains of the top 20 percent have jeopardized the well-being of the bottom 80 percent. Incomes have stagnat- ed and the robust 3 percent growth rates of the 1950s and ’60s are long gone. If we have a consumption problem, this view implicitly states, we can solve it by getting more income into more people’s hands. The goals are redistribution and growth.
It is difficult to take exception to this view. It combines a deep respect for indi- vidual choice (the liberal part) with a commitment to justice and equality (the egalitarian part). I held it myself for many years. But I now believe that by failing to look deeper—to examine the very nature of consumption—it has become too lim- iting. In short, I do not think that the “in- come solution” addresses some of the most profound failures of the current consumption regime.
Why not? First, consuming is part of the problem. Income (the solution) leads to consumption practices that exacerbate and reproduce class and social inequali- ties, resulting in—and perhaps even worsening—an unequal distribution of income. Second, the system is structured such that an adequate income is an elusive goal. That is because adequacy is rela- tive—defined by reference to the incomes of others. Without an analysis of con- sumer desire and need, and a different framework for understanding what is ad- equate, we are likely to find ourselves, twenty years from now, arguing that a median income of $100,000—rather than half that—is adequate. These argu- ments underscore the social context of consumption: the ways in which our sense of social standing and belonging comes from what we consume. If true, they suggest that attempts to achieve equality or adequacy of individual incomes without changing consumption patterns will be self-defeating.
Finally, it is difficult to make an ethical argument that people in the world’s richest country need more when the global in- come gap is so wide, the disparity in world resource use so enormous, and the possibil- ity that we are already consuming beyond the earth’s ecological carrying capacity so likely. This third critique will get less atten- tion in this essay—because it is more famil- iar, not because it is less important—but I will return to it in the conclusion.."

			<p>	In the text The New Politics of Consumption, Juliet Schor discusses consumerism in our culture and society and how it is progressively getting worse, causing great damage to our planet. We are told that the key to our happiness is making a good income and living a "middle-class standard of living." Schor argues against this solution, claiming it will only make things worse, leading to poor consumption practices and an impossible-to-reach "adequate income."
As consumers, we compare ourselves to those around us to gauge what we have and how wealthy we are. We compare our houses and cars to our neighbors’ and to our coworkers’. As this system has evolved, it has shifted to include comparisons with people on television and celebrities, leading to overconsumption in an attempt to achieve the lifestyle that is so heavily glorified and promised by a higher income.
Consumption has turned into a form of competitive competition, with people constantly trying to outdo each other in order to stay in their class or move up to a more idolized class based on the things they possess. This behavior causes people to buy more and more things they don’t need but want, in order to maintain their social status rather than saving. Schor states that nearly a quarter of households live paycheck to paycheck. The comparison to others has led us to glorify brands, claiming them to be elite and premium, paying more not for their material worth, but simply for the appearance they provide to others. I think this text is very informative and points out many problems in our society that are slowly dooming us. There are numerous facts in the text showing the increase in poverty and living paycheck to paycheck, all because we simply consume too much. The growth of consumer culture has also caused us to overuse the materials the Earth has given us. But because there is demand, there must be supply, so we keep using more and more of our limited resources.	
Consumerism is not only damaging American society but also the whole world. Even if you don’t live in a consumer-based society like America, we all share the same Earth. If we are using too many materials to satisfy people's wants over needs, nobody will have anything left for our essential needs. This article did a great job highlighting how consumerism is deeply rooted in our society and progressively making it worse to live in.
Again, like many other concepts we have read in class, the suffering of the 80% is empowering and benefiting the 20%, and little to nobody recognizes it or is doing anything about it. I had never even thought about how bad our consumption in this country is until I read this text. It’s a serious issue that I think needs to be taken much more seriously.
