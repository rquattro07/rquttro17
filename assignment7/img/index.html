	The placebo effect is the idea that your brain can convince your body that a fake treatment is actually a real one and is working to heal you. Scientists have found that the placebo effect not only convinces your brain that you are healing, but it has also been proven to be just as effective as some treatments used to heal. It is most often claimed that placebo medicines are only used in trials for real drugs to test their effectiveness against fake ones. In many of these trials, especially in recent years, patients felt the same effects or at least an improvement after taking the placebo medicine compared to the group that took a real drug. There are also accounts of doctors treating injured soldiers with the placebo effect due to a shortage of medicine at the time. An army doctor in World War II named Henry Beecher claimed that the placebo effect was effectively used to help treat gunshot wounds, severe pain, and sickness. The placebo effect has many different uses and has been proven effective in treating a variety of issues such as pain, illness, and mental illnesses. With so much research proving the effectiveness of placebo medicines and the undoubtedly cheaper price to make them, who’s to say they aren’t already being used as a form of treatment? The placebo effect could even be present in your everyday life without you ever realizing it, but if you don’t realize it’s there, it must be working, right?

	<p>The purpose of our research is to educate people on the effectiveness of placebo medication in relation to treatment. Another reason for the research is to demonstrate that placebo medicine is actively being used without our knowledge. This medicine could be employed in an effective way to treat certain conditions more cheaply and without the actual use of drugs. A more sinister possibility is that this could be a tactic to inflate the price of medication while, in reality, patients are receiving placebo treatments, generating more profit for the bourgeoisie.

	<p>It’s common knowledge that if you have a headache or pain, you take ibuprofen or another drug to relieve it. This has become a habitual concept for most people. We associate these pills with recovery and the alleviation of pain. Because we believe so confidently that they will help us, they most likely will. Given this belief, do large brand companies really need to include active ingredients in their pills? They could have switched from real drugs to placebos years ago, and we would never have known. Furthermore, the original formulas could have been fake from the very start; they might have been placebos all along.
